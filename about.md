<div class="manual-content">


I work as a Senior Data Scientist at Digitas Inc. Currently I am passionate about robotics, embedded deep learning and understanding Bayesian methods in machine learning.
This blog is intended to be my scribbling place for hobby projects and things that I find interesting.
