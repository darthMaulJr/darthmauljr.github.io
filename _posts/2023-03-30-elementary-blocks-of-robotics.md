Lately, I've been curious if embedded machine learing could simplify life, primarily along the lines of having a robot assistant or improved home automation. This blog post is about getting the basic hardware in shape for working towards that goal.

#### Choosing the processor

When enthusiasts think about processors for hobby embedded application projects the one that first comes to mind is the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>. However, supply chain issues in recent years have made it really hard to obtain one. For this reason, I started researching for alternate candidates and among them Jetson Nano was a clear winner. Jetson Nano is a small yet powerful computer developed by Nvidia Inc.  It can run AI frameworks and models, and is very power efficient. It is also supported by <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack">Nvidia's JetPack SDK</a>.

In addition, it is priced reasonably for the hardware included. 


#### Building the Chassis

It's actually really simple! Add the rating in your YAML front matter. It also supports halfs:
