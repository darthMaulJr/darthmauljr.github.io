<ul>
 <li> Project: Automated House Plant Watering <br/>
      Description: The Automated House Plant Watering project utilizes a microcontroller (<a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s2-43012/">CY8CKIT-062S2-43012</a>) connected to an HTTP server to automate plant watering in a home environment. With the help of sensors, the microcontroller monitors soil moisture. An HTTP server facilitates remote access through a web interface, enabling the user to monitor plant conditions and control watering operations. <br />
